This project mocks a menu for a pizza restaraunt. The goal for this project was to demonstrate clean CSS for a very user-friendly and readable finish, as well as to use JavaScript to make the menu dynamically generated. The script.js contains a database in the form of a JavaScript object of menu sections and items that the script generates with html to form the menu you are viewing. Script.js also handles the dropdown menu functionality for user control over what they are trying to view. I aimed for this project to be the ultimate mobile menu for restaraunts and establishments alike.
